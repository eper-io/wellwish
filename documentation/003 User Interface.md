# Grotto User Interface

The user interface concept of WellWish came from the realization of new technologies and
the changing landscape in 2020.

Browsers, html, javascript, gif, png, jpeg are all decades old.
They were invented in an era of slow wired networks and slow processors.
Mobile networks fueled the usage of these technologies further. Not anymore.

The new internet is different and this solution will reconcile well.
There are millions of designers and software developers.
New generation of cell phone networks are fast,
and many have access to fiber networks from their home internet ether.

The workflow is changing.
It is normal to download basic concepts, or generate them with artificial intelligence.
The creative work changed to business, and reviews.
Processor development slowed down, you do not need cutting edge animations anymore to sell a new device.

Our expectation was that people will need more diverse and detailed design experiences.
They will also leverage more graphics processing from cloud solutions.
This requires a seamless, simple and friendly application interface.

We designed a different user experience with a lean client.
Our concept can be used on an edge node, and throughout the cloud without modification.
We use technologies that do not require a degree.

This allows significant user base changes.
An Arduino allows you to create a device with few hundred lines in a day.
We will allow many non-techie people to design end to end systems with the same efforts.

There is no need of debugging, and when there is a need you just get all the traces in plain English.
The database is your traces. Your accountant can read the raw data file on disk.
You can read them without understanding what little endian, bytes,
stack, inherited objects, or critical sections are.
We use Englang, a tech variant of English or Engineering Language to describe data, code, behavior, inter-server interface, and logs.

We design our own simple image based client.
There are no browser dependencies, fancy enable cookie buttons, public key certificate chains that you need to master to get started.

Even if something goes wrong, your tech professional can deal with thousands of lines instead of tens of millions of lines of software to shovel.
There is a quick ramp up time, just like with the best cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, or DigitalOcean.

We provide a simple drawing library, where most of your favourite drawing tools can be used to export a background.
Adding button behavior is just few dozen lines of code.
Still, third parties can build on the concept and create their own tools to support your creativity.
Nothing is locked.

Do you remember all the account names and passwords of the hundredandfiftyfive sites you signed up for?
Do you get marketing flood from these sites?
Have you ever wondered why you need a hybrid public key certificate for private peer communication?

We prefer sessions to accounts.
Sessions are random unique session ids generated on the fly just for your convenience.
You just send or keep the unique browser address to get back, or to share a chat window.

You get customers instantly as they drop to your site.
There is no need to fill emails, accept cookies, etc.

Purchases can be done by filling out an order form and paying later, if your local policies allow such a construct.
Consult with a local professional.

Payments can be done by dragging and dropping an invoice, paid bill or coin file like a vending machine.
Use a USB stick, if you need more security.

Some may opt for more technologically orthodox, object-oriented conservative systems like Unix, Java, or Python.
They may use Golang, Node, or Englang.

It is a very low investment marketing funnel from the customer side.
There is no account, no information needed, no commitments.
It is a casual solution, they can use the service right away.
Also, it allows flexibility of the backend technologies used.


Cheers...
